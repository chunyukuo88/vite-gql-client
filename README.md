# Wai Kuai 外快

### The client of a bookkeeping project that will replace the shell scripts I used to use.

### Technologies:

- GraphQL via graphql-request
- Bulma, a CSS library
- PNPM
- Vite
- TypeScript

### Good references:

- A [refresher](https://www.sammeechward.com/cognito-user-pool-react) on integrating Cognito into your React app by Sam Meacham-Ward.
- This app was not created using the Amplify framework, I am just using the auth API. It took a while to find the docs for doing it this way, so [here](https://docs.amplify.aws/react/tools/libraries/configure-categories/#pageMain) it is.
